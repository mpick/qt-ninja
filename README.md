## üìñ How to Read the Indicators

### SMT Lines
- **Red/Bearish Lines**: One asset broke the prior high, the other(s) did not
- **Green/Bullish Lines**: One asset broke the prior low, the other(s) did not
- **Labels**: Show which comparison asset caused the divergence (e.g., "SI", "PL")
- **No Label**: The primary asset (chart instrument) caused the divergence

### Interpretation
- **Bearish SMT (Red)**: 
  - Comparison asset makes new high, primary doesn't
  - Suggests potential bearish reversal or weakness
- **Bullish SMT (Green)**:
  - Comparison asset makes new low, primary doesn't
  - Suggests potential bullish reversal or strength

### Example
If you're viewing GC (Gold) and:
- SI (Silver) breaks yesterday's high at 10:00 AM
- GC fails to break yesterday's high at the same time
- **Result**: Red line drawn from yesterday's GC high to current candle, labeled "SI"

## üí° Usage Tips

1. **Timeframe Selection**:
   - Daily: Use 60m charts for clarity
   - Weekly: Use 240m charts or daily
   - Session: Use 15m charts
   - 90m Cycle: Use 5m charts

2. **Data Loading**:
   - Increase "Days to load" in chart properties (30-90 days recommended)
   - This allows scrolling back to see historical divergences

3. **Multiple Timeframes**:
   - Run different SMT indicators on different timeframes simultaneously
   - Higher timeframe divergences often more significant

4. **Triad Analysis**:
   - Enable all three metals (GC, SI, PL) for comprehensive analysis; you can use Copper HG instead of Platinum PL
   - Other Common Triads are these
   - The Index Triad; ES/NQ/YM (alternative you can use NKD instead of YM)
   - The Fuels Triad; CL/RB/HO
   - The Currencies Triad; 6E/6B/6S (DXY inversion SMT currently is not capable, suggested to use Swiss Franc in place of DXY)
   - The Bonds Triad; UB/TN/ZF
   - The Crypto Triad; BTC/ETH/SOL
   - Look for confluence when multiple divergences align


## üß† Strategies Included

### 1. LevelBreakRecover.cs
Sets a Limit Order at a desired level once a User Inputted quantity of bar closures occur below/above the desired level, and then a "recovery" takes place where price makes bar closures below/above the desired level in the quantity of bar closures set by the user. 

### 2. ReentryTest.cs
Sets a Limit Order at a desired level and will fill once price hits the level. TP & SL settings given by the user, if the TP is hit, a duplicate order will be re-created at the original level waiting to be filled again.
